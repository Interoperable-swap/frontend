### A. Project Description x1.

***InteroperableDEX, not Multi-chainDEX.***

Polkadot is promoting WASM-based Smartcontract that utilizes ink! . And this application is the first AMM for [Uniswap v2 based on ink!-based smartcontract](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/wasm-showcase-dapps/tree/main/uniswap-v2). In fact, this hackathon's scope is only a basic implementation, such as Swap and liquidity provision features. However, we will be extending the functionality to become a DEX aggregator for the entire Polkadot Ecosystem utilizing XCM, and interoperability with existing EVM Dapps utilizing AstarNetwork's XVM!

### 3.- The actual challenge statement you are submitting to and a general description of the problem you are addressing

***Liquidity aggregation and interoperability among DEXs***

The Polkadot Ecosystem includes a variety of chains, including application-based chains, in addition to chains as Smartcontract execution environments. Even now, each chain is developing its own liquidity solutions and DEXs, and from the user's point of view, the liquidity offered is distributed and very UX-unfriendly. Although development was not completed in time for this hackathon, we will continue to develop solutions to these issues.

At the moment, there are only a few runtime environments, including Shiden and Shibuya, and unlike EVM applications, there are only a few projects that can be used as references. 
Therefore, we had a hard time connecting SmartContract to the front end using the Polkadot{js} API. 
Thanks to the Polkadot community for the heads up!

### 4.- How you use the Substrate or EVM project.

We uses Pallet Contract based on Substrate framework and can achieve interoperability with existing EVM Dapps utilizing AstarNetwork's XVM feature

## B. Video presentation up to 5 minutes x1

This is a recorded presentation of your team presenting your project and solution. The video presentation must include at least the following:

1.- Name of the project

2.- Description of the design, novelty/originality, technical complexity, daily/mass usability and impact of the project (these are the evaluation criteria!).


## C. Link to GitHub Repo x1

Each team must designate 1 (one) person to create the team's GitHub repository and share access with the team to collaborate. During the presentation, the team must submit the link to this GitHub repository that can be accessible to the judges.


D. List of technology stack used x1

This is a list of the technology stack used by the team to build their project.


E. Project demo link
